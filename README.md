# Flappy Bird Is Back :bird:
===============

*Flappy Bird* was a simple, yet notoriously difficult mobile game that became popular in 2013. 
The game's design was reminiscent of the 8-bit video games of the 1980s, and its challenging gameplay and addictive nature made it a sensation, especially among young gamers. For many of us, playing Flappy Bird was a fun and memorable part of our childhood, as we tried to beat our friends' high scores and push ourselves to new heights of gaming prowess.

To bring back the golden memories of our lost childhood, I have created this game using PyGame. Hope you enjoy it üíù

## The rules of Flappy Bird Game are simple: :scroll:

1. The objective of the game is to navigate a small bird through a series of pipes without touching them.

2. The bird automatically moves forward, and the player must tap the screen to make the bird flap its wings and fly higher.

3. Each time the bird successfully passes through a set of pipes, the player earns one point.

4. The game ends if the bird touches a pipe or the ground, and the player must start over from the beginning.

5. The game gradually increases in difficulty, with the pipes coming closer together and the gaps between them getting smaller.

6. There are no levels or stages in the game, and the player can continue playing indefinitely as long as they can avoid touching the pipes or the ground.

7. The game has no time limit, and the player can take as long as they need to navigate through the pipes.
